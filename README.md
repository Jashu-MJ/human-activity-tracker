# human-activity-tracker

1.data cleaning was done by droping the null values.

2.i have used keras model a simple sequential multi perceptron layer to implement and find the accuracy.

3.the dataset was collected using and android app in the phone . the csv data contains date,time ,duration,activity,loaction,etc...

4.in this model i  have just used 2 features as input and one-hot encoding for output feature as it is a string and fed to the model.

5.i have used k fold cross validation for calculating the accuracy and optimizer is Adam.
